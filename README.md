</p>

This is a multi-agent and case-based reasoning system for algorithmic trading (multi-threading Flask server with multiple agents). This system allows user to get recommendation on whether buy/sell/hold a cryptocurrency in HitBTC exchange.

## Description
The manual of the final project of [IS5006 Intelligent Systems Deployment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P0G6ujiBn6GsEXasSgORsdnBm7O68_yV/view?usp=sharing) module at National University of Singapore.

We are tasked with designing and implementing a  system for **Algorithmic trading**. Given the highly complex and decentralized nature of the problem, a multi-agent system (MAS) design is a natural approach for building an efficient solution without requiring expert engineering. The goal of our system is to:
- make recommendation(s) on whether to buy or sell cryptocurrencies
- take action(s) based on the recommendation(s) etc.
